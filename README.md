This is your base class repo.

Projects should be in the lab-[123] directories, with your slides and
notes for presentations in the -presentation directories.

When your lab is finished, tag it Release 1.0.  IF you need to update after
that, tag that as Release 1.1, etc.

For lab-3, start by copying all of lab-2 into the lab-3 directory, and save
that as a new commit.
